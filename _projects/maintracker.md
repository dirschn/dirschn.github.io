I've always been fascinated by cars, computers, and knowing random statistics. This project is a way for me to combine
all 3 of those, while also building a very useful tool. Maintracker is a place for you to keep everything
related to your vehicles- receipts, documentation, and more! The more you put in the better it gets, too! You'll get
reports of how much money you've spent over time and on which parts. You will also get your vehicle's fuel
miles per gallon (MPG) over time, if applicable.

## Features

### Fuel logs

Fuel is easily the most frequently purchased "part" for any powered vehicle. Now, you can keep track of exactly how much
you spend on it.

Consistent tracking will also provide you with accurate MPG measurements. Over time, you'll get a good idea of how
efficient your vehicle is, and see what can affect mileage- like temperature and driving style!

### Maintenance Records

While you (hopefully!) won't be having maintenance done on your vehicle nearly as often as you refill the tank, it's
arguably more important to keep good track of any maintenance done. These purchases are often far more expensive and
can come with warranties- both very good reasons to be sure you don't lose the receipts that came with them! You can
upload as many images or PDFs of receipts as you need to for each maintenance record to ensure you always have access
to them when you need them.

### More!
There are more features, and soon they'll all be outlined here!

## Plans

I have lots of plans for the future with this project, and soon this section will detail them all!
