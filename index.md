# Hello!

Thanks for joining me! I'm happy to have you here! This is a site dedicated to showcasing what I've done and hope to do in the future. It's quite new and very much under construction, but I hope that you find it helpful whether you're thinking of hiring me, a friend I told to check it out, or some random person who came here by accident! Whatever the case, here's a picture of my cat Mouse to entice you to stick around.
